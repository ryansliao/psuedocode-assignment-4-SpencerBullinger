How to play the Game of War:

- Two people
- up to an hour of gameplay

 Use a deck of 52 cards that includes two jokers.
 Shuffles this deck of 52 cards.
 Split the shuffled deck into two groups of 26.
 Give each player a group of 26 cards.
 Each player puts the deck facedown on a table.

Round One:

 Each player pulls the top card off.
 Each player then places the top card face side up on the table.

 There are now two cards on the table.
 These cards face opposite directions and are face up.
 /* the player should see the number or face, not the generic back */

 Compare the values of the two cards.
 Determine which card has the greater value.

 /* 2<3<4<5<6<7<8<9<10<jack<queen<king<ace<joker */

If: Both cards have the same value:/* Double War Sequence */

	Leave both cards on the table in their original position.
	Each player will place 3 cards facedown onto the table behind their current card from the above tie.
	Each player will take another card from the top of their deck and place it face up on the listed table.
	Which ever of these singular cards has the greater value is the winner.
	
	If: Both cards have the same value, repeat the previous sequence: */ Double War Sequence */
		
		Else:
			The player who placed the winning card is the winner.
			The winning player will take all the cards on the table. 
			This includes the six facedown cards.

Else:
	The player whose card value is of greater value takes both his card and his opponent's. 
	This same player then puts the two cards face down on the bottom of his deck.
	This concludes round one.
	Initiate round two.

Round Two:
`
Repeat Round One instructions.
Continue on through multiple rounds.

If: One player has no cards:
	
	The opposing player wins.
	
		Else:
	
			Continue playing until the above condition is satisfied.

 Continue onwards with more and more cards.
 The player that controls all the cards wins.
